🐾 Cat Clicker🐾
A simple incremental game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Cat Clicker is a lighthearted browser-based incremental game inspired by classics like Cookie Clicker. 
Built as a personal project to practice core front-end development skills, this game combines fun gameplay with foundational web technologies.

Key Features:
-> Click-based incremental gameplay with score tracking
-> Simple UI built with semantic HTML
-> Custom styling and animations using CSS
-> Interactive logic and state management with vanilla JavaScript

💡Purpose:
This project was developed as a way to strengthen HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. 
It serves as both a learning exercise and a fun example of how web technologies can be used to create interactive experiences.

Feel free to explore, play, and modify the code!
